## Technologies
Project is created with:
* IntelliJ IDEA
> * With openJDK 1.8 

	
## Setup
Install [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/download/#section=windows) in your computer.

Then in the extensions tab search for **Java Extension Pack** and install it.

Start your proyect creating your files with **.java**  

## Summary
In this course talk about all what can be done and some benefits from using Object Oriented Programming, they mention what is a class, what is an object, and some core ideas like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism, I will explain a little bit of those now. All examples are in java 1.8

### Classes
 A class is the model that you define to create objects it contains, an identifier, properties and methods.
this is the most basic component in OOP (Object Oriented Programming) with this you can modulate your program by creating different classes with their respective atributes and methods.
> here is an example:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        showMenu();
    }//end of main
}//end of Main class
```
### Abstraction
An abstraction is when you recognize that you need a specific properties that you will used repeatedly in your code, so you abstract them and create a class, this help you to reduce your code and have a better struture in your proyect.
> In the next example you can abstract the class **User** because you know that you will have many users with this specific atributes. 
```java
public abstract class User {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String address;
    private String phoneNumber;

    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }
}
```

### Encapsulation
To encapsulate a class is when you protect your variables/properties and control how has access to them with the private/protect/public/default options this is very important to know exactly who have access to which variables, and create the methods to get those atributes or modify them.
> Also is important to know that you will need to create the getters and setters to acces those properties.
 ```java
public class Doctor{
    //Atributo
    private String speciality;
    private ArrayList<AvailableAppointment> availableAppointments = new ArrayList<>();

    public Doctor(String name, String email){
        super(name,email);
    }

    public String getSpeciality() {
        return speciality;
    }

    public void setSpeciality(String speciality) {
        this.speciality = speciality;
    }



    public void addAvailableAppointment(String date, String time){
        availableAppointments.add(new Doctor.AvailableAppointment(date,time));
    }

    public ArrayList<AvailableAppointment> getAvailableAppointments(){
        return availableAppointments;
    }
 }
```
### Inheritance
Having inheritance it is very useful to write less code becuase you know that several classes used common properties or methods and there is when you used Inheritance, and also you can **Override** a method to fulfil any need you have.
>For example in this case when a Nurse is also a User so we need all their atributes and methods but, we will change the method showDataUser so it can adjust to our needs.
 ```java
public class Nurse extends User{
    private String speciality;

    public Nurse(String name, String email){
        super(name,email);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDataUser() {
        System.out.println("Empleado del hospital: Cruz verde");
        System.out.println("Departamentos: Nutriologia, Pediatria");
    }

    public String getSpeciality() {
        return speciality;
    }

    public void setSpeciality(String speciality) {
        this.speciality = speciality;
    }
}
```
### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is when you re define what a method can do, it is commonly used when you have an abstract class and you want to inherit some properties and methods but depending on what you want your class to do then you can **Override** that method to do what you need.
 ```java
public class Doctor extends User {
    //Atributo
    private String speciality;
    private ArrayList<AvailableAppointment> availableAppointments = new ArrayList<>();

    public Doctor(String name, String email){
        super(name,email);
    }

    public String getSpeciality() {
        return speciality;
    }

    public void setSpeciality(String speciality) {
        this.speciality = speciality;
    }



    public void addAvailableAppointment(String date, String time){
        availableAppointments.add(new Doctor.AvailableAppointment(date,time));
    }

    public ArrayList<AvailableAppointment> getAvailableAppointments(){
        return availableAppointments;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return super.toString() + "\nSpeciality: " + speciality + "\nAvailable: " + availableAppointments.toString();
    }

    @Override
    public void showDataUser() {
        System.out.println("Empleado del Hospital: CRuz Roja");
        System.out.println("Departamento: CancerologÃ­a");
    }
}
```

### Abstract_Class
The abstract class is for when you know that there will be no instances of that class you only used it to inherit properties or methdos, this is very useful for example in a school you may need the class person to have all the basic atributes and methods but you know that you will only have the class/objects of student and teacher for example they can inherit from person.
>This is an example for an abstract class.
 ```java
public abstract class User {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String address;
    private String phoneNumber;

    public User(String name, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.email = email;
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }

    public void setEmail(String email) {
        this.email = email;
    }

    public String getAddress() {
        return address;
    }

    public void setAddress(String address) {
        this.address = address;
    }

    public String getPhoneNumber() {
        return phoneNumber;
    }
}
```
### Interfaces
The interfaces are similar to abstract classes but they don't have the same limitation of only having only 1 "parent" and they could be implemented in any class, it is normally used to control other clases or add/share a common method between classes 
 ```java
public interface IScheduleable {
    void schedule(Date date, String time);
}
```
